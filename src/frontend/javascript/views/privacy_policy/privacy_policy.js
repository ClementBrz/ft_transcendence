	<h1>Welcome to the Pong Privacy Extravaganza!</h1>

	<p>Thank you for playing Pong, the classic game of pixelated ponginess! We take your privacy almost as seriously as we take our pixel placement. Here's what we do (and don't do) with your data:</p>
		
	<h2>Data Collection: The Non-Collecting Edition</h2>
	<p>We collect absolutely zero personal data. Nada. Zip. Zilch. We don't even collect your high scores, though we’re totally impressed if you get a score of over 1000! We just want you to have a good time.</p>
		
	<h2>Cookies: The Only Kind We Know About</h2>
	<p>Our game doesn’t use cookies. Unless you're talking about the chocolate chip ones, in which case, feel free to share. We prefer to keep your experience sweet and cookie-free. No crumbs here!</p>
		
	<h2>Third-Party Shindigs</h2>
	<p>We don’t have any third-party advertisers trying to sell you random stuff. No pop-ups, no banners, just pure, unadulterated Pong fun. You won’t find any sneaky tracking devices here.</p>
		
	<h2>Data Security: Our Highly Scientific Approach</h2>
	<p>Our security strategy involves lots of high-tech stuff like locking the game console when we're done and hoping no one spills soda on it. Seriously though, since we don’t collect data, there's nothing to secure.</p>
		
	<h2>Your Rights: You Have None (But Not in a Bad Way)</h2>
	<p>Since we don’t gather or store any personal data, there are no rights to exercise. You don’t need to worry about requesting data deletions or access, because there’s nothing to delete or access. You’re all set!</p>
		
	<h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
	<p>We might update this policy from time to time, but don’t worry, it will always be just as non-intrusive and amusing. Any changes will be posted right here, so you’ll always be in the loop (or the pong, in this case).</p>
		
	<p>If you have any questions or just want to chat about Pong, feel free to <a href="mailto:contact@ponggame.com">email us</a>. We love to hear from our fans, especially if you have tips on how to improve our Pong skills!</p>
