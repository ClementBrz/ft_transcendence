	<p>Welcome to the Pong Game Terms of Service, where we keep things as fun as a pixelated paddle battle! By playing our game, you agree to the following terms. Don’t worry, it’s not as scary as it sounds:</p>
		
	<h2>1. No Cheating</h2>
	<p>We have a strict no-cheating policy. That means no hacking, no exploiting glitches, and no summoning magical powers to get an unfair advantage. Play fair and square—or at least, pixel by pixel!</p>
		
	<h2>2. Use of Game Data</h2>
	<p>We don’t collect or use your game data for anything nefarious. Your scores stay between you and your screen. We promise not to share your high score with the aliens, the robots, or anyone else (unless you brag about it yourself).</p>
		
	<h2>3. Respect Other Players</h2>
	<p>Be nice to other players. No trash-talking, no virtual bullying, and definitely no attempting to hack their paddles. Remember, we're all here for a good time, not a digital showdown.</p>
		
	<h2>4. Updates and Changes</h2>
	<p>We might occasionally update our terms to reflect new features or changes in the game. If we do, you’ll see the updates right here, and hopefully, they’ll include even more fun stuff for you to enjoy.</p>
		
	<h2>5. Limitation of Liability</h2>
	<p>We’re not responsible if you become so addicted to Pong that you forget to eat, sleep, or do your chores. Play responsibly and remember that while Pong is awesome, real life is also pretty great!</p>
		
	<h2>6. Contact Us</h2>
	<p>If you have any questions about these terms or just want to share your Pong strategies, feel free to <a href="mailto:contact@ponggame.com">email us</a>. We love hearing from our players, especially if you have tips on how to beat the game!</p>
		
	<p>By continuing to play, you’re agreeing to these terms. Enjoy the game and may your paddle always be swift!</p>
